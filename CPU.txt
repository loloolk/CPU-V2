Fixed Length Instruction Encoding
1 - Immediate SRC1, 1 - Immediate SRC2, 1 - Inverter, 4 - OPCODE, 3 - SRC1, 3 - SRC2, 3 - DST

Reg Codes:
0-7: a, b, c, d, e, f, bp, sp
COMPARATOR BITS:
less, equal, greater, not equal

OPCODES:

0x00 - noop - No Operation
0x01 - mov - Move data from SRC 1 to DST
0x11 (INV) - Not SCR 1 and store in DST
0x02 - And SCR 1 & SRC 2 and store in DST
0x12 (INV) - Nand SCR 1 & SRC 2 and store in DST
0x03 - Or SCR 1 & SRC 2 and store in DST
0x13 (INV) - Nor SCR 1 & SRC 2 and store in DST
0x04 - Xor SCR 1 & SRC 2 and store in DST
0x14 (INV) - Xnor SCR 1 & SRC 2 and store in DST

0x05 - Add SCR 1 & SRC 2 and store in DST
0x06 - Sub SCR 1 & SRC 2 and store in DST
0x07 - Shl SCR 1 and store in DST
0x08 - Shr SCR 1 and store in DST

0x09 - cmp - Compare SCR 1 and SRC 2 (result store in compare register)
0x0a - jmp - Jump to address defined in SRC 1
0x0b - je - Jump to address defined in SRC 1 if equality bit is set in compare register
0x1b (INV) - jne - Jump to address defined in SRC 1 if equality bit is not set in compare register
0x0c - jl - Jump to address defined in SRC 1 if less-than bit is set in compare register
0x1c (INV) - jge - Jump to address defined in SRC 1 if less-than bit is not set in compare register
0x0d - jg - Jump to address defined in SRC 1 if greater-than bit is set in compare register
0x1d (INV) - jle - Jump to address defined in SRC 1 if greater-than bit is not set in compare register

0x0e - wrt - Write the memory at address SRC 2, the data in SRC 1
0x1e (INV) - push - Write mem at address in sp, the data in SRC 1, increment sp by 1
0x0f - read - Read mem at address SRC 2, store in DST
0x1f (INV) - pop - Decrement sp by 1, read mem at address in sp, store in DST. 

Immediate Value Overwrites SRC1

Sub Commands:
res - Resets register by xoring it with itself (same as mov 0, 1 clock tick faster)

Future Possible Improvements:
Floating Point Operations
Visual Interface
RAM to PROGRAM pipeline (load programs from RAM into instructions)
Signed support
Peripheral interface (?)
Support for immediate values on SRC2

For 4 bit (x) by 4 bit (y) multiplication
for i=0-4 {
If x & 0x1 == 1 {
x += (y << 4)
x >> 1
}
}
